<div class="faq-item">
    <input type="checkbox" id="q13">
    <label class="faq-question" for="q13">Why my hosting or account is being block?</label>
    <div class="faq-answer">Your hosting has been temporarily blocked because our system detected activity that goes against our Community Guidelines. We understand this can be frustrating, but these guidelines are in place to keep FRND safe and respectful for everyone.

If you believe this was a mistake or would like to appeal, please reach out to our support team — we’re here to help.</div>

<div class="faq-item">
    <input type="checkbox" id="q14">
    <label class="faq-question" for="q14">Can warnings lead to my account being blocked?</label>
    <div class="faq-answer">Yes. Repeated warnings for not following our Community Guidelines can lead to your account being blocked. Serious violations — such as using abusive language, engaging in nudity or sexual conversations, sharing personal information, or committing fraud — may result in an immediate block.

Please note, every warning is carefully reviewed by our team before any blocking action is taken.</div>

<div class="faq-item">
    <input type="checkbox" id="q15">
    <label class="faq-question" for="q15">What are the community guideliens for the FRND app?</label>
    <div class="faq-answer">Our Community Guidelines are designed to keep FRND safe, respectful, and enjoyable for everyone. Here are the key points to follow:

Be respectful – Avoid abusive, offensive, or disrespectful language.

No nudity or sexual content – Keep conversations and interactions clean.

No sexual talks – Maintain a safe and comfortable environment for all users.

Do not share personal information – Such as phone numbers, addresses, or bank details.

No fraud or scams – Any dishonest or harmful activity is strictly prohibited.

Follow all laws and regulations – Ensure your activities comply with applicable laws.

Breaking these guidelines may lead to warnings, suspension, or permanent blocking of your account. Our moderation team reviews each case carefully before taking action.</div>

<div class="faq-item">
    <input type="checkbox" id="q16">
    <label class="faq-question" for="q16">My account is temporarily blocked for one day. Do I need to worry?</label>
    <div class="faq-answer">Your account has been temporarily blocked because of a violation of our Community Guidelines. Think of this as a warning from the FRND Team — it’s a chance to review the guidelines and ensure it doesn’t happen again.

If similar violations continue, your account could be permanently blocked. Follow the rules, and you’ll be able to enjoy FRND without any interruptions</div>

<div class="faq-item">
    <input type="checkbox" id="q17">
    <label class="faq-question" for="q17">Can my account be unblocked once it’s permanently blocked?</label>
    <div class="faq-answer">No. Once an account is permanently blocked, it cannot be unblocked. This action is taken only after repeated or serious violations of our Community Guidelines. We strongly encourage all users to follow the guidelines to avoid reaching this stage.</div>
